      <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco Iowa</li>
        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
          Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Conservation Corps,helping
          starving Americans. " I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me".</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes University and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Marget Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired
          by Elvin Charles Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest- resistant plants.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbour attack, but is rejected.
          Instead the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,disinfectants, and other
          applied science. </li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a PH.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology. </li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,leaves behind his pregnant wife and flies
          to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team bread 6,000 different
          strains of disease resistant wheat-including
          different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,doubling wheat yields</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short ,sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American
          breed,creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high - yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
          subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population. </li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - states " we will have to double the world supply by 2050". Argues that genetically
          modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are
          not inherently dangerous because
          "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,people
          were selecting the best breeds".</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95</li>
      </ul>
